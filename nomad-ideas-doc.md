## Game Modes

##### Relic capture
Relics are scattered across the map, and the player who manges to secure all of
them wins.

##### Survival
The world hates you and will do everything in its power to wipe you out. How
long can the players survive its progressively harder attacks.


----
## Unit Classes
The base version of the game provisions only a few unit classes.  More unit
classes would extend the depth of the gameplay.  Ideas for new unit classes are
listed below:

##### Wizard
- Elemental attacks with fire/lighting/ice.
- Takes a long time to produce.
- Weak in close combat.

##### Healer/Monk
- Passive unit that slowly restores the health of all units in their radius.
- Weak and non combative.

##### Hero
- A heros has strong attacks and also buffs the stats of all units in range.

##### Summons
- Powerfull otherworldly creatures that exist for limited periods of time

##### Ranger
  - Villager with a wolf companion (Large line of sight)

## Passive Buildings
Passive buildings are those which exist on the map from the start and which
have a class that cannot be constructed by any player.  These buildings may be
captured however.
An example of such a building may be 'Ruins' which can train wizards.  Buildings
such as these can form a resource for players to fight over.


----
## Passive Events
The land is alive and it does not want you there.  Random events trigger on the
map that are often negative for all affected players.  Random events increase
tension and can shift the balance of power.

- Lightning storm
- Flooding
- Forrest fire
- Dead come back as skeletons / zombies


----
## Neutral Units
Neutral units may exist on the map and will attack any player without the direct
objective of winning.  Neutral units do not have a controlling player.

Neutral units could also be converted to the first player to encounter them,
rewarding expansion.


----
## Passive Creatures
- Troll
- Wolf
- Zombie/Skeleton

## Map Details
- Bird flocking
- Rabbits
- Trees loosing their leaves
- Snow/Rain/Storm
